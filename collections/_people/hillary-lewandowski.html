<p>
  Hillary Lewandowski is a 2006 graduate of Marian High School. She completed a bachelor of science in both biology and computer science in 2012 from Oakland University and a graduate certificate in biomedical sciences in 2013. Hillary has been working as a website developer since 2007, using her skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to build websites. Her projects have ranged in size from simple, one-page websites to complicated applications that took over a year to complete. On top of being a full stack developer, Hillary's job also works closely with her clients to plan out every aspect of a project. She also sets aside time to guide and mentor junior developers on best practices. Hillary is currently employed at Michigan Creative at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. When she's not working, Hillary gets to spend quality time with her many pets, and enjoys visits out to different Michigan lakes.
