## @file
## Jekyll configuration
##
## We try to push as much sitewide config as possible into this file, so a new deployment can start with just editing
## this file.
##
## If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:
## https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml
## https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
##
## Throughout this file, you'll see two # marks at the start of a line for a permanent comment, and a single # for
## configuration options that can be enabled by removing the #.
##
## When adding new sections, be sure to name them so they make sense to others, and to document with good comments
## wherever possible/practical.

## Technical site info
#baseurl: "" # This is better empty
#subpath: "/finished-starter" # Could be a subsite of a domain at a path, ex. "/sub-site"
#google_analytics: UA-697953-3 # The UA- code provided by GA

## The option below lets you choose between having Jekyll process and minify your CSS and JS (good enough), or adding a
## step whenever you work on a CSS or JS file to run the .scripts/pre-commit.sh script before committing. This extra
## step minimizes the size of the CSS/JS files for better front-end performance, but is obviously kind of a pain in the
## butt.
no_pre_commit_dependencies: "false, style and script" # Set to true to make the site work without added script hooks
filament_load_css: "false" # Use the https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/ technique to async CSS.

## Content-Security-Policy is preferably something to set in the HTTP headers, but is available here just in case.
## @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
#content_security_policy: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"

## Placing them here sets them to be preloaded in the head, which reduces request chaining for better performance.
